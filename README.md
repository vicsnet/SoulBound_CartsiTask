The SoulBound smart contract is a decentralized application (dApp) that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. It is written in Solidity, a programming language specifically designed for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. This document aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the SoulBound contract, its purpose, and responsibilities, from the perspective of web3, blockchain, and dApp.

Purpose of the SoulBound Contract
The primary purpose of the SoulBound contract is to facilitate interactions with digital assets known as tokens. In the realm of blockchain and web3, tokens are digital assets that can be transferred between accounts. They can represent a variety of things, from digital currencies to ownership rights of a digital or physical asset.

The SoulBound contract is specifically designed to work with a type of token standard known as ERC1155. This is a standard interface for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, providing a set of rules that all ERC1155 tokens must adhere to. This standard allows for the creation of both fungible (identical and interchangeable) and non-fungible (unique) tokens within the same contract.

Responsibilities of the SoulBound Contract
The SoulBound contract has several key responsibilities:

Token Claiming: The contract includes a function called claimToken that allows users to claim a certain amount of tokens. This is a necessary step before a user can mint (create), receive, or transfer tokens.

URI Setting: The contract includes a function called setURI that allows the owner of the contract to set a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This is a string of characters that provides a simple way to identify a resource, which in this case would be a specific token.

Token Minting: The contract includes a function called mintToken that allows users to create new tokens, provided they have already claimed tokens as mentioned above.

Token Transfer: The contract includes a function called transfer which is to transfer token. only owner whose token claimed digit is divisible by 2 can transfer token and receive token
